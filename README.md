#üõ°Ô∏è HTB-Hard-AD-Web-Writeups üï∏Ô∏è
Mastering the toughest challenges in Active Directory & Web Exploitation.

Welcome to my personal arsenal of in-depth write-ups for Hack The Box (HTB) machines! This repository is dedicated to breaking down the most challenging 'Hard' difficulty boxes, with a sharp focus on real-world Active Directory (AD) and intricate Web exploitation techniques.

About This Arsenal üí°
Forget surface-level solutions. Here, each write-up isn't just a walkthrough; it's a deep dive into the methodology, the mistakes, and the "aha!" moments. I dissect the entire penetration testing process, from initial reconnaissance and vulnerability identification to sophisticated privilege escalation and full system compromise.

My goal is to provide unfiltered, step-by-step explanations of complex attack chains, showcasing the tools, commands, and crucial thought processes required to conquer these formidable machines. Whether you're a fellow hacker, a student, or a security enthusiast, these detailed analyses are designed to elevate your understanding and refine your skills.

Featured Conquests üèÜ
