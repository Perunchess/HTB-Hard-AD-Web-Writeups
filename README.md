HTB-Hard-AD-Web-Writeups
Welcome to my collection of in-depth write-ups for Hack The Box (HTB) machines! This repository focuses specifically on 'Hard' difficulty machines that challenge skills in both Active Directory (AD) and Web exploitation.

About This Repository
This space is dedicated to sharing my detailed penetration testing journeys on Hack The Box. Each write-up aims to walk you through the entire process, from initial reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery to achieving full system compromise and privilege escalation.

My goal is to provide clear, step-by-step explanations of complex attack paths, command usage, and the thought process behind solving these challenging machines. Whether you're learning, reviewing techniques, or looking for a solution, I hope these write-ups prove useful.

Current Write-ups
Mantis: A challenging journey involving web enumeration, creative credential decoding, and exploiting Active Directory vulnerabilities like MS14-068 to achieve domain dominance.

Coming Soon
I'm continuously working on new machines. Expect more write-ups covering various advanced AD and Web exploitation scenarios in the future!
